= Jonathan's Music Player

This Music Player is copyright Â© 2018 by Jonathan Cast,
and is licensed under the GNU General Public License, version 3 or later.

This software is $5/month to use.
While, under US copyright law, I cannot force you to pay this,
if you like this music player and enjoy using it, I ask you to please consider paying for the software you use.

This software is developed under the terms of https://github.com/jonathancast/open-developed-software ,
except that, for now, I reserve the right to make small changes to myself to meet my own needs.

However, feature requests, bug reports, patches, and PRs are *not* welcome from other users,
unless you a) pay for the software and b) comply with the process outlined in that web page.

And, obviously, c) recognize that paying $5/month doesn't buy a lot of development time,
and plan accordingly.

My time bills at $120/hr;
if I actually get paying users for this, I will pay myself at $60/hr,
and pay other developers at $30/hr for brand-new users, increasing by $3/hr per year of experience to a maximum of $60/hr.
Billing will always be 2x what the developer gets paid, but I won't take profits from that;
instead, I will use it to support the project as a whole and hire non-programmer employees (if it rises high enough).
